### Hi 👋

My name is Gregory Conrad and I live in the Boston area (USA).
I've been programming since I was around 11 and I've used quite a variety of languages since then!

Currently, I’m maintaining a few libraries I developed for Rust and Dart/Flutter, including:
- ♾️ ReArch (novel approach to application architecture across languages)
- 🔎 Mimir (Dart/Flutter embedded database featuring typo-tolerant and relevant full-text search)
- 🧱 native_toolchain_rs (build your Rust code into a Dart project via Dart's Native Assets feature)
